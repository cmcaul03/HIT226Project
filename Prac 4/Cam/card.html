            <h2>Linear Notes</h2>

            <h2>Mind Maps</h2>

            <h2>Networks</h2>
            <p>This basically makes use of a slash pattern to organise ideas. It is especially useful if you are trying to map out the ideas in a debate or controversy. It enable opposing ideas to be mapped e.g. pros/cons, costs/benefits, advantages/disadvantages, and so on.</p>

            <h2>Herringbone Technique</h2>
            <p>The herringbone technique, so-named because it resembles a fish skeleton, is useful for analysing a single idea. You ask of the main idea Who?, What?, When?, Where?, Why?, and How? In so doing you are able to represent the key idea and aspects of its supporting data.</p>
